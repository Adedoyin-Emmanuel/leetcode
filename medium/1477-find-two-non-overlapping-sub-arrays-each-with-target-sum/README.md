<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/find-two-non-overlapping-sub-arrays-each-with-target-sum/">1477. Find Two Non-overlapping Sub-arrays Each With Target Sum</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><p>You are given an array of integers <code>arr</code> and an integer <code>target</code>.</p>

<p>You have to find <strong>two non-overlapping sub-arrays</strong> of <code>arr</code> each with a sum equal <code>target</code>. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is <strong>minimum</strong>.</p>

<p>Return <em>the minimum sum of the lengths</em> of the two required sub-arrays, or return <code>-1</code> if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6
<strong>Output:</strong> -1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> We have only one sub-array of sum = 6.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= arr.length &lt;= 10<sup>5</sup></code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= arr[i] &lt;= 1000</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= target &lt;= 10<sup>8</sup></code></li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Hints</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Let's create two arrays prefix and suffix where prefix[i] is the minimum length of sub-array ends before i and has sum = k, suffix[i] is the minimum length of sub-array starting at or after i and has sum = k.</li>
<li>The answer we are searching for is min(prefix[i] + suffix[i]) for all values of i from 0 to n-1 where n == arr.length.</li>
<li>If you are still stuck with how to build prefix and suffix, you can store for each index i the length of the sub-array starts at i and has sum = k or infinity otherwise, and you can use it to build both prefix and suffix.</li>
</ul>
